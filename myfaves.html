        <h2>Dogs=Life</h2>
        <img src="images/aussie_dog.jpg" alt="Australian Shepherd Dog" class="left-card-image">
        <p>My dogs keep me busy. My Australian Shepherd, Tracer, is named for the video game my family loves to play called <i>Overwatch</i>. He's just a pup but he's already such wonderful member of our family.</p>

        <p>My dog Bosley is a Great Pyrenees, and as his name suggests, he really is great! He's 18 months old and is already bigger than a Great Dane. He loves to guard our house against big threats like neighborhood cats, lizards, and the occasional leaf that might blow into the yard.</p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>I love to read. I could probably finish about three books a day if I had nothing else to do. Unfortunately there's this thing called life. Ugh. Here are a few of my favorite books:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>The Call of the Wild</i></li>
            <li><i>Outlander</i></li>
            <li><i>Hamlet</i></li>
            <li><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i></li>
            <li><i>Into the Wild</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm also a huge grammar nerd so I know all about the art of punctuation and can diagram a sentence like nobody's business. You're probably really impressed right now.</p>
